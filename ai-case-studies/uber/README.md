### Context
Ridesharing services like Uber have revolutionized urban transportation, offering flexible, on-demand rides across major cities. In New York City, Uber operates in a highly dynamic environment where demand fluctuates based on time, location, weather, holidays, and local events. Understanding these patterns is crucial for optimizing driver allocation, pricing, and customer satisfaction.

### Objective
As a Data Scientist at Uber's New York Office, your goal is to extract actionable insights from the Uber rides dataset to help the business grow. This involves analyzing how various factors—such as weather, time, and holidays—influence ride demand, and providing recommendations to capitalize on these trends.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset (`Uber_Data.csv`) contains hourly-level details of Uber pickups across NYC boroughs, along with weather attributes. The columns include:
- **pickup_dt**: Date and time of the pickup (hourly granularity)
- **borough**: NYC borough where the pickup occurred
- **pickups**: Number of pickups in that hour
- **spd**: Wind speed (miles/hour)
- **vsb**: Visibility (miles)
- **temp**: Temperature (°F)
- **dewp**: Dew point (°F)
- **slp**: Sea level pressure
- **pcp01**: 1-hour liquid precipitation (inches)
- **pcp06**: 6-hour liquid precipitation (inches)
- **pcp24**: 24-hour liquid precipitation (inches)
- **sd**: Snow depth (inches)
- **hday**: Holiday indicator (Y/N)

### Key Questions
1. **What variables influence the number of Uber pickups?**
   - Analyze the impact of weather (temperature, precipitation, wind, visibility), time (hour, day, holiday), and location (borough) on ride demand.
2. **Which factor affects pickups the most? Why?**
   - Use statistical and visual analysis to identify the strongest predictors of demand, such as rush hours, boroughs, or severe weather.
3. **What recommendations can help Uber capitalize on fluctuating demand?**
   - Suggest strategies for surge pricing, driver deployment, and marketing based on demand patterns.

### Analysis Guidelines
- **Univariate Analysis**: Explore the distribution of each variable (e.g., pickups by hour, temperature, borough).
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Examine relationships between pickups and other variables (e.g., pickups vs. temperature, pickups vs. precipitation, pickups by borough and hour).
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Combine multiple factors to understand complex demand patterns (e.g., pickups by hour and weather, or by borough and holiday).
- **Visualization**: Use line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and boxplots to reveal trends and correlations. Include sample visualizations (see attached image for inspiration).

### Example Insights
- **Temporal Trends**: Identify peak hours and days for pickups. Highlight differences between weekdays, weekends, and holidays.
- **Weather Impact**: Show how rain, snow, or extreme temperatures affect ride demand. For example, demand may spike during heavy rain or snow due to reduced public transit use.
- **Geographical Patterns**: Compare demand across boroughs. Some areas may have consistently higher or more volatile demand.
- **Holiday Effects**: Analyze how holidays influence ride volume, and whether certain boroughs see larger changes.

### Recommendations for Uber Management
- **Dynamic Driver Allocation**: Increase driver availability in high-demand boroughs during peak hours or adverse weather.
- **Surge Pricing Optimization**: Adjust pricing algorithms to account for weather and holiday effects.
- **Targeted Promotions**: Offer discounts or incentives during low-demand periods or in under-served areas.
- **Weather-Responsive Operations**: Prepare for demand surges during storms or extreme weather by pre-positioning drivers.

### Deliverables
- A detailed analysis notebook or report with:
  - Data cleaning and preparation steps
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
  - Key findings and insights
  - Actionable recommendations for Uber management
- A presentation summarizing the most important insights and business actions
