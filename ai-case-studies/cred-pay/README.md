# Cred-Pay Case Study

## Problem Definition

### Business Context
**Cred-Pay** is a consulting firm that partners with banks to assess customer eligibility for credit cards. As a startup at the early stages of its journey, Cred-Pay has established partnerships with a few banks and is in the process of collecting and analyzing data for credit card applications. The success of their business model depends on efficiently organizing and utilizing this data to assist banks in making informed decisions.

### Objective
As a Data Scientist, your role is to manage and structure the raw data collected by Cred-Pay. The primary objective is to organize the data in a way that ensures easy accessibility and usability to:
1. Derive meaningful insights.
2. Enable predictive modeling for determining credit card application approval likelihood.
3. Support banks in making data-driven decisions for credit card issuance.

## Solution Approach

### Understanding the Problem
To design a solution, it is essential to understand the key factors that influence credit card eligibility. Based on the research and initial analysis, the following features have been identified as crucial for credit card application assessments:
- **Customer ID (CID):** Unique identification for each customer.
- **Credit Score:** A numerical representation of a customer's creditworthiness.
- **Age of Customer:** The age of the applicant, which may influence credit risk.
- **Debt Status:** Current financial obligations (e.g., in-debt or no-debt).
- **Number of Existing Credit Cards:** The count of active credit cards owned by the customer.

### Data Preparation
To facilitate predictive modeling and insights generation, the raw data needs to be structured and cleaned. Below is a sample dataset extracted for initial exploration and analysis:

| **CID**    | **Credit Score** | **Age of Customer** | **Debt Status** | **No. of Existing Credit Cards** |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| cid-0001   | 650              | 25                  | in-debt         | 3                                |
| cid-0002   | 723              | 28                  | no debt         | 2                                |
| cid-0003   | 581              | 38                  | no-debt         | 4                                |
| cid-0004   | 462              | 41                  | in-debt         | 1                                |
| cid-0005   | 773              | 62                  | no-debt         | 2                                |

## Next Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Standardize **Debt Status** values (e.g., unify "no debt" and "no-debt").
- Validate **Credit Score** values to ensure they fall within a valid range (e.g., 300–850).
- Check for missing or duplicate entries in the dataset.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the distribution of credit scores across different age groups.
- Evaluate the correlation between credit score and the number of existing credit cards.
- Investigate any trends in debt status and credit card ownership.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Develop a machine learning model to predict credit card application approval based on the provided features.
- Use classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Insights and Reporting
- Generate insights to inform Cred-Pay’s strategies and recommendations for partner banks.
- Visualize key metrics and relationships within the data using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Conclusion
This structured approach to organizing and analyzing customer data will enable Cred-Pay to assist its banking partners effectively. By leveraging predictive analytics and actionable insights, Cred-Pay can enhance its value proposition and establish itself as a trusted partner in the financial services sector.
