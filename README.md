# AI Playgrounds

Welcome to **AI Playgrounds**, a repository created to explore, experiment, and prototype Proof of Concepts (POCs) around AI tools and technologies using Python. This is a dynamic space designed to facilitate quick experimentation and learning in the ever-evolving field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Objectives:
- Serve as a playground for testing and building quick POCs around AI tools, frameworks, and techniques.
- Provide a space for learning, experimenting, and iterating on AI concepts.
- Continuously expand with new POCs as required, keeping the repository fresh and relevant.

## Contributions:
Contributions are warmly welcomed! Whether it's improving existing POCs, adding new experiments, or sharing ideas, your inputs are highly valued. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to collaborate.
