# Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)

Seamless Agent Collaboration: Introduces a standard protocol for autonomous, opaque agents built on different frameworks and by various vendors to communicate and collaborate effectively with each other and with users, addressing the current lack of agent interoperability.

Simplifies Enterprise Agent Integration: Provides a straightforward way to integrate intelligent agents into existing enterprise applications, allowing businesses to leverage agent capabilities across their technology landscape.

Supports Key Enterprise Requirements: Offers core functionalities essential for secure, enterprise-grade agent ecosystems, including capability discovery, user experience negotiation, task and state management, and secure collaboration. Open standards for connecting Agents

## Getting Started with an Example

To help you understand the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol in practice, a simple "Echo Agent" example is available in this repository. This example demonstrates the basic principles of A2A, including:

*   Defining an agent's capabilities (Agent Card and Skills).
*   Implementing the agent's logic (Agent Executor).
*   Running an A2A server.
*   Creating a client to interact with the agent.

You can find the example and instructions on how to run it here:
*   [Simple A2A Echo Example](./a2a_example/README.md)

**Note:** This example requires Python 3.13+ due to the `a2a-sdk` dependency.
