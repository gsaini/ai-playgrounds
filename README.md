Welcome to **AI Playgrounds**, a repository created to explore, experiment, and prototype Proof of Concepts (POCs) around AI tools and technologies using Python. This repository serves as a dynamic space for quick experimentation and learning in the ever-evolving field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Objectives
- **Experimentation**: Test and build quick POCs around AI tools, frameworks, and techniques.
- **Learning**: Provide a space for learning, experimenting, and iterating on AI concepts.
- **Expansion**: Continuously expand with new POCs, keeping the repository fresh and relevant.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **AI Case Studies**
- Focuses on applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems.
- Includes projects like Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
