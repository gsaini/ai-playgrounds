# Automated Sentiment Analysis for E-Commerce Customer Reviews

## Problem Statement

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, customer reviews are a critical factor influencing product perception and purchasing decisions. Businesses must extract actionable insights from these reviews to remain competitive. Failure to monitor and address customer feedback, especially negative sentiment, can result in:

- **Customer Churn:** Dissatisfied customers may leave for competitors, reducing long-term revenue and market share.
- **Reputation Damage:** Persistent negative sentiment can harm brand reputation, deterring potential customers.
- **Financial Implications:** Negative reviews can lead to decreased sales and profitability as customers turn to competitors.

## Business Context

A rapidly expanding e-commerce platform specializing in electronic gadgets has experienced a 200% growth in its customer base over the past three years. Recently, the volume of customer feedback has surged by approximately 25% in just six months, coming from various channels such as product review forms, surveys, and social media.

Manual analysis of this feedback is no longer feasible. The business seeks an automated, scalable solution to analyze and categorize customer sentiment efficiently.

## Problem Definition

The organization aims to implement a lexicon-based sentiment analyzer to automatically classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. The solution should:

- Parse product reviews using predefined sentiment dictionaries and rules.
- Efficiently handle large volumes of feedback.
- Provide accurate sentiment predictions to support business decision-making.

As a Data Scientist, you are provided with a dataset containing customer reviews, each labeled with its sentiment. Your task is to build a sentiment analyzer that can accurately predict the sentiment of new product reviews.

## Data Dictionary

- **Product ID:** Unique identifier for each product.
- **Product Review:** Text of the customerâ€™s review.
- **Sentiment:** Label indicating the sentiment of the review (positive, negative, or neutral).
